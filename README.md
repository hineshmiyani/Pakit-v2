# Pakit V2 - Multisignature Wallet

Pakit is a multisignature decentralised wallet application. It allows a user to create as many multisig wallets as they like by putting the owner's
address and the required confirmations on the Goerli chain with some test ethers or ERC20 Tokens.
Using the NextJs Framework and Material UI, I
built a front-end and integrated the Safe Core SDK and Safe Service Client API for all multsig wallet functionality.

# Features âœ¨

- The user can connect their wallet (metamask).
- The user can create a new wallet.
- The user can transfer Ether and ERC20 tokens to the wallet.
- The user can propose an Ether and ERC20 transfer transaction.
- The user can accept and execute the transaction.
